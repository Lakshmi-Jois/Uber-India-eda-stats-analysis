 üîç Possible Analyses

-   Demand vs Supply: Analyze peak booking hours, high-demand
    routes.
-   Cancellations: Study reasons for cancellations by both customers
    and drivers.
-   Performance Metrics: Correlate driver/customer ratings with ride
    outcomes.
-   Revenue Insights: Explore booking values and ride distances.\
-   Operational Efficiency: Investigate Avg VTAT & Avg CTAT to
    assess waiting times.
